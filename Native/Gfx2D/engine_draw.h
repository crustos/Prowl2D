/* The host's view of what Crust's GLES 3.1 renderer (gles3_render.h, gles3_batch.h) asks of the engine it draws.
 *
 * In unity_pack this header is generated for each project, and its functions are the packed engine's. Here it is fixed, and gfx2d.c answers it from the
 * batch of sprites the game hands over: a procedural two-sprite atlas, no lights, no per-sprite textures. The structs are copied from the packer's
 * (tools/unity_pack.py and tools/unity_pack_gpu2d.py in crust) and must stay the same size and layout: the renderer reads EngineGpuSprite from the GPU
 * with these offsets. If the renderer's expectations move, gfx2d.c stops compiling here, which is the point of including it instead of copying it.
